Chrome Extension Icons Required
================================

The Chrome Web Store requires icon files in the following sizes:

- icon16.png  (16x16 pixels)  - Favicon in the browser toolbar
- icon32.png  (32x32 pixels)  - Windows and Linux taskbar
- icon48.png  (48x48 pixels)  - Extension management page
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - Chrome Web Store listing

Recommended Design:
- Simple, recognizable logo for JobRadar
- Use a radar icon or job search theme
- Ensure the icon is clear and readable at small sizes
- Use transparent background (PNG format)
- Keep colors professional (blues, greens, or brand colors)

Tools for Creating Icons:
- Canva (free, easy to use)
- Figma (free, professional)
- GIMP (free, open source)
- Adobe Illustrator (paid)

For now, you can test the extension without icons by loading it as an "unpacked extension" in Chrome.
The icons are only required when publishing to the Chrome Web Store.
